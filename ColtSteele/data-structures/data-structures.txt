* We will be reviewing a ton of data structures and defining them from scratch:
 - Binary Search Trees
 - Binary Heaps
 - Queues
 - Priority Queues
 - Singly Linked Lists
 - Doubly Linked Lists
 - Undirected Unweighted Graphs
 - Directed Graphs
 - Hash Tables
 - Stacks

* What do they do?
 - Data structures are collections of values, the relationship among them and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data

* Why so many??
 - Different data structures excel at different things. Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.

* Why care?
 - The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures
 - Also, we work with them all the time already
 - Interviews, der. Might ask:
    - Reverse singly linked list
    - Implement a priority queue
    - Balance a binary tree

* Using ES15 Class syntax in all of these data structures
