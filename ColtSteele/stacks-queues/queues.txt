* What is a queue?
 - A data structure that you add and remove data from but the order is FIFO - first in, first out
 - Exist everywhere:
    - Background tasks
    - Uploading resources
    - Printing / task processing
 - Foundational for larger data structures

* Building a queue with an array
 - Push onto & shift out of (or unshift and pop) - but shifting & unshifting are bad for big O

* Big O Notation: (same as stacks)
 - O(1) since we're using a Singly Linked List and pushing to end and shifting from the front
 - Insertion & remove - O(1)
 - Searching & access - O(n)
