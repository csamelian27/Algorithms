Much faster but more challenging! Less intuitive to write on your own, meatier, juicier, but faster.

- The 3 algos we've learned so far (bubble, selection, insertion) don't scale up well as they are O(n^2)
- The 3 new algos we'll learn (quick, merge, radix) improve time complexity to O(n log n)

* Gonna implement: O(n log n) time complexity
 - Quick sort
 - Merge sort
 - Radix sort
